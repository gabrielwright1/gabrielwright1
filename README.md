About
-------------------------------
- My name is Gabe, I am a front end developer with a background in process improvement and user experience design. 

- Throughout my career in the power industry, I've improved legacy processes by identifying opportunities to reduce waste through automation. By listening to user feedback and learning from their experiences, I am able to make better design decisions. With this approach, I aim to reduce misery by building solutions that respect the user’s time. I am currently pivoting into development to learn how to create more powerful tools.

- In the future, I will be using React JS to impact users from around the world.
