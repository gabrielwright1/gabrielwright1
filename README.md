About:
- My name is Gabe, I am a front end developer with a background in process improvement and user experience design.  
- Throughout my career in the power industry, I've improved legacy processes by identifying opportunities to reduce waste through automation. By listening to user feedback and learning from their experiences, I am able to detect subtle details that I use to guide my design decisions. With this approach, I reduce misery and build solutions that respect the user’s time. I am pivoting into development to gain a granular understanding of how to build more powerful tools.
- In the future, I will be using React JS to impact users from around the world.
